## Objective
The aim of this project is to construct a manual approach of recognising images of handwritten digits and compare its performance with a neural-network led approach to classification. 

## Dataset
**MNIST** dataset is used which contains 28x28 black and white images of handwritten numerical digits (from 0 to 9). More information about this dataset can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database
